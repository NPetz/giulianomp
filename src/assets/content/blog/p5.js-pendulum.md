The time it took the sphere to swing from end to end was determined by an arcane conspiracy between the most timeless of measures: the singularity of the point of suspension, the duality of the plane's dimensions, the triadic beginning of _pi_, the secret quadratic nature of the root, and the unnumbered perfection of the circle itself.
